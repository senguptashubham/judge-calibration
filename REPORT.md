Small, dated empirical observations that inform a design decision but don't belong to
a specific RQ section yet. Promoted into the relevant RQ section once that section is

### Temperature scaling invalidates `p_a` for `sample_idx > 0` (D6) — confirmed empirically, 8 Sep 2026

**Claim (D6):** `p_a` (renormalised P(A) from top-K logprobs) is only valid for the
canonical greedy call (`sample_idx == 0`, T=0). Sampled draws (`sample_idx > 0`, T=0.7)
report logprobs scaled by temperature, so `p_a` computed from them is not comparable to
the T=0 value and must not be used as a calibration signal.

**Method:** for all 20 items in task 1.6's pilot (`clean`/P1/AB), compared the greedy
call's `p_a` against the first sampled draw's `p_a` for the same item. Split by whether
the two calls agreed on the verdict itself, since a verdict *flip* between temperatures
is a different, expected phenomenon (genuine sampling variability — the basis for
`conf_sc`), not evidence about logprob scaling.

**Result:**
- 2/20 items had the sampled draw pick a different verdict than the greedy call —
  expected, not evidence for or against the D6 claim.
- Of the 18/20 items where **both calls agreed on the verdict**, `p_a` still differed
  between T=0 and T=0.7 in every single case: mean absolute difference ≈ 0.00038,
  maximum ≈ 0.0067 (item `5ea559a223e8e898`: 0.0067 at T=0 vs 2.3e-9 at T=0.7 — several
  orders of magnitude in relative terms, despite a small absolute gap, since both values
  sit near the confident extreme).

**Conclusion:** D6's restriction is empirically justified, not just a theoretical
precaution — temperature measurably shifts the reported logprob distribution even when
it doesn't change the model's actual decision. `conf_lp`/`p_a` correctly come from
`sample_idx == 0` only.

### Verbose prompt-token multiplier, throwaway padding — 8 Sep 2026

**Purpose:** an early, rough read on how much longer `verbose` condition prompts get,
to sanity-check the GPU-budget extrapolation ahead of the real `verbose_pad()` (task
4.1, W4). Deliberately throwaway - the padding used here (a fixed filler sentence
repeated 5x, appended to each assistant turn) is not the real repetitive-list-attack
design from Zheng et al. §3.3 that task 4.1 will implement.

**Method:** 10 items sampled from the dataset (seed 1234), `P1`/`AB` prompts rendered
both clean and with the throwaway padding applied to both sides' conversations, real
token counts via `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct`'s own tokenizer (not a character-count
approximation).

**Result:** multiplier ranged 1.07x–1.44x across the 10 items, mean **1.19x**.

**Conclusion:** consistent with `TASKS.md` task 1.6's own stated expectation
("+20-40% wall-clock, not 2-3x - padding lengthens the prompt, and prefill is cheap
next to decode"), now backed by a real tokenizer measurement rather than an assumption.
The real `verbose_pad()` (task 4.1) may land at a different multiplier - this is a
sanity check on the current GPU-budget estimate's order of magnitude, not a
substitute for re-extrapolating once the real perturbation exists.
